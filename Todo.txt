Missing authentication pipe

Could register a stopwatch as the start pipe and track time of use cases
Or, do stopwatch at start of controller action in framework and stop it after everything finishes (full operation time)

Could combine above two points to see a breakdown of what takes the bulk of the time, the framework or the core layer
